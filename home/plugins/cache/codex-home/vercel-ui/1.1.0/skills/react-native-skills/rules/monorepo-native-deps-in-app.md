# monorepo native deps in app

Apply the following monorepo native deps in app guidance to the code or configuration you are changing. Check the stated preconditions and preserve behavior outside the authorized scope.

## Install Native Dependencies in App Directory

In a monorepo, packages with native code must be installed in the native app's
directory directly. Autolinking only scans the app's `node_modules`—it won't
find native dependencies installed in other packages.

**Incorrect (native dep in shared package only):**

```
packages/
  ui/
    package.json  # has react-native-reanimated
  app/
    package.json  # missing react-native-reanimated
```

Autolinking fails—native code not linked.

**Correct (native dep in app directory):**

```
packages/
  ui/
    package.json  # has react-native-reanimated
  app/
    package.json  # also has react-native-reanimated
```

```json
// packages/app/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-reanimated": "3.16.1"
  }
}
```

Even if the shared package uses the native dependency, the app must also list it
for autolinking to detect and link the native code.
